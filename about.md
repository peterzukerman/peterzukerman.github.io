![](profile.png =250x250){:class="img-responsive"}
I'm a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I am studying Computer Science and Linguistics, with an interest in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am minoring in East Asian Languages and Cultures, and am actively working towards business proficiency in Japanese and Korean.

I have had 3 technical internships and 1 volunteer experience related to computer science. I was a software engineering intern at OverDrive Inc., Optima Solutions, and Rockwell Automation. I also volunteered at the CodeMash software convention, and gave a presentation on Unicode and text input. I am currently interning at VoiceItt, and I am part of their speech processing development team.

At university, I am involved in the AI research group, SIGAI. I am also a member of the computational linguistics league, and am doing statistical machine translation research on Siberian Yupik, a critical language in Alaska.

Currently I'm working at VoiceItt in Tel Aviv, Israel. There I do signal processing research and work to improve the speech recognition algorithm for noisy environments and accented speech.
