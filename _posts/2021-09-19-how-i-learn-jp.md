title: "How I Studied Japanese"
comments: true

---

I started studying Japanese around 10th grade of high school. One day I came home and told my parents that I wanted to study, and they both told me the same thing: "Why Japanese? Isn't it ridiculously hard?" I've attempted to answer that question throughout the years - first, it was a fascination with culture and media. Then, it transformed into a linguistic curiousity. And now, it's both of those, combined with the social aspects of speaking with Japanese people that have kept me motivated through my 6 year journey.

In this post, I'll talk about Japanese as a language (from a native English perspective), discuss resources I've used throughout the years, and what my current approach is. At the end, I'll also touch on how these techniques can be applied to the study of any other language.

## Is Japanese really that hard?

Yes and no. Japanese has lots of aspects about it that are particularly annoying. I've told people in the past that it's almost as if somebody went in and specifically made the language as nuanced and difficult to memorize as possible. 

In particular, the most difficult part is the multiple readings that each character has. For the most part, a character by itself, say '海' (eng: umi - sea/ocean), uses the 'kun'yomi' reading (native japonic origin). Compare that to the compound word '海岸 (eng: kaigan - ocean coast)', and the reading for that same character changes to it's 'on'yomi' (native chinese origin) reading. This is a simple case - there's only two readings for this character depending on the context. There are more extreme examples, with characters like 日 having over 5. Learning Japanese requires precise knowledge of when to use each reading, and might be a particular source of difficulty for comprehending spoken Japanese.

Not everything is complicated, though. There are no noun declensions like in German or Russian. Likewise, verb conjugation is mostly done through suffixes, with some exceptions (as with all languages). The language is phonotactically very simple (there are very few actual sounds one makes), and is 'agglutinative', meaning the stem of the word rarely changes during conjugation.

All in all, I don't see it as any easier or harder than other languages I've studied, and ultimately, the difficulty of a language pales in comparison to the strength of an individual's motivation to study!

## My Japanese Level

As of writing this, I can safely say that my Japanese is on the level of business proficiency. I can comprehend most media with relative ease, as well as understand some more nuanced fields, such as economics, linguistics, and computer science. My casual Japanese is at a comfortable level, but it will never get to the point I dream of unless I live there for some time. I still have a long way to go to complete fluency, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

## What I've Tried

### High School

In the very beginning, I took 1-on-1 tutoring lessons with a native speaker for about half a year. We used a textbook called Genki for my studies. This was tremendously effective and helped me get off to a very strong start, allowing me to self study through to my freshman year of college.

#### 1-on-1 Tutoring
If you can afford it, 1 on 1 tutoring is incredibly helpful when you start your language learning journey. Getting the pronunciation down and starting basic speaking practice from the very beginning is proven to be one of the best things you can do for a strong foundation. Look for local tutors in your area, or head over to [Italki](https://www.italki.com/?hl=en) and find one online.

#### Genki Textbooks 1 + 2
These textbooks serve as the best introduction to standard Japanese. Both self study, tutoring, and classrooms use these textbooks and my personal recommendation is to start out with them. They cover a variety of useful beginner grammar points, as well as a good number of characters.

#### Nakama Textbooks
Nakama is ok. It's definitely more suited to a classroom environment, so if you're getting tutored or self studying, stick to Genki. That being said, they're still very good and offer pretty much the same result as Genki, so if you can find one of these for cheap, don't hesitate to use it.

### College

#### Japanese Courses
I took two years of Japanese at University before ultimately deciding to continue studying on my own. The first year, we used Genki 2, and the second year we used Tobira. The benefit of the classes is a daily schedule with homework and conversation classes. It's quite helpful to converse with the professor and other students on a daily basis, as well as check your understanding with exams and homework. It's also quite difficult to fall behind, as your professor can and will call on you every day. 

There are quite a few negatives, however. First and foremost, classes usually force you to learn writing. I personally had no interest in learning to write Kanji, although there is some merit improving your memorization. Furthermore, since the lesson plans and topics are determined by your professors, you can't skip things that don't interest you (prime example being hyper-formal speech, which was 1 month of class time).

#### Tobira Gateway to Advanced Japanese
The most useful textbook you can use in your journey to fluency. The readings are exciting and valuable, providing unique insights into Japanese culture and lifestyle. The grammar is very well explained, fits neatly into the structure of the JLPT N3, and is efficiently reflected in the readings. The characters are introduced carefully, and solidify any intermediate learner's Kanji background. This textbook is a slight jump from Genki 2, but it's well worth it. Mastery of the material in this textbook allows one to be quite confident in their language abilities in a wide variety of situations.

### Miscellaneous 

#### Wanikani
A widely popular Kanji study tool. I used it for a year and a half, on and off. You can learn as many as 2000 Kanji and 6000 vocab words in a little over a year (provided you study everyday and have a high retention rate during your studies). That being said - I do recommend it, but it's just not for me. It's quite expensive in my opinion (monthly subscription - 9 USD, annual 89 USD) for what it offers. Still, a gamified, lovely to look at online app with a very active community, streamlined approach with no work required from the user is quite attractive to many. I just don't use it but that's mainly because I use-

#### Anki
The holy grail. My daily driver for any and all learning for the past 4 years of my life. This little app has seen me through math, computer science, linguistics, and language learning. I strongly urge everyone to give this app a try. It's completely free, I wrote an article about it [here](https://zuker.io/articles/2019-07/anki), and will quite literally *supercharge* your learning. I'll touch on which decks I use at the end of this article.

#### Italki
A 1-on-1 online language learning service where you can schedule lessons with either professional teachers (certified by the website) or community tutors (native language speakers). This is the second resource I recommend for any language, and I've been taking 6 lessons a week (2 japanese, 2 chinese, and 2 russian) for a couple of months now. Starting speaking practice as soon as you can is beneficial for confidence as well as a solid grasp of the spoken language. Professional teachers are useful for those looking for a more structured approach - I've had lessons with them for Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, and in all 3 cases, they have developed a full lesson plan akin to one you might find in a classroom (only tailored specifically to your needs). Now, all my lessons are with community tutors - they tend to just correct little mistakes in your grammar or speaking styles, and I love some of the conversations we have. In recent memory I've discussing the COVID-19 epidemic, the olympics, travel, Japanese politics, and origami.

## How I Study Now
- **Anki** *(Daily)*

	I'm using Nayr's Core 5k, subs2srs mined flashcards for anime and TV shows, and a completed Kanji in Context deck as a review.
- **Italki** *(Bi-weekly)*

	2 lessons a week with a Japanese community tutor. Sometimes we read news/manga together, other times just chat about the recent happenings in our lives.
- **Media** *(Daily)*

	I try to read, watch or listen to Japanese content as much as I can. Videos on youtube, podcasts, and news websites make up the majority of my media consumption, and I try to do this daily.

That's it! I don't use too many resources now because I don't need to - most of the grammar/vocab I pick up is from media and tends to be very nuanced, so I learn it when I encounter it.

## Recommend Study Plan (0 to Hero)
Here's how I would study as a complete beginner. If you are more advanced, jump to the point in the plan that you are on in your own studies.

1. **Genki 1, Anki , Optional Italki/Tutoring**

	In this step, we want to learn the alphabets (there's 3) of Japanese, get some basic grammar and speaking practice under our belt, and commit it to our long term memory. Load everything and anything into Anki, or use a premade deck for Genki 1.

2. **Genki 2, Anki, Italki, Optional Wanikani/Anki Kanji Deck**

	At this point, I think speaking practice is no longer optional. Find a tutor, join a local conversation table, or find any way to practice speaking. Furthermore, as we get more comfortable with grammar and characters, some media opens up, so don't be afraid to venture into the wild and find some easy manga/shows to watch! The Kanji learning at this step is optional, but encouraged. Genki 1 + 2 cover around 300 characters, and any you learn on your own will never hurt.

3. **Graduate to Tobira, incorporate media**

	This is the transition from beginner to intermediate. Make sure you have a sound method for committing grammar, vocab and characters to your long term memory - whether that's quizlet, anki, or some other service (even handwritten). Continue learning Kanji from your personal deck or from Tobira - they're all super useful. As you make your way through Tobira, even more native material opens up to you, so start reading blogs, news sites, and listening to podcasts or music!

4. **Nirvana**

	After Tobira, you can consider yourself a strong learner of Japanese. You have the tools (grammar, characters, vocab) to start learning almost entirely from media. If you so desire, you can prep for the JLPT exam and use a textbook designed specifically for that exam. But other than that, you've progressed through the hardest part! Do what makes you happy with the language - chat with native speakers, watch tough shows, read Murakami (with a dictionary, of course). I'm proud of you! Very few learners make it this far in any language.
	
## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on my learning journey. If you're studying a language other than Japanese, just replace the textbook recommendations with those in your particular language (like *Integrated Chinese* for Mandaring), and follow the same approach of Anki, lessons, and media consumption. If you learned something or have any questions, feel free to contact me. Otherwise, happy sentence mining, content consuming, and Japanese learning!
