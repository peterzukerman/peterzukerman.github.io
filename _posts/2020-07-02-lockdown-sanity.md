COVID-19 has made our lives difficult, uncomfortable, and unpredictable. But some good has come out of it - namely, many of us find that we have hours of free time that we don't know what to fill with. Recently I picked up a few hobbies that I dropped in middle and high school to see what progress I could make. In this post I'll talk about Origami.

# Inspiration

I've been folding for many years. I started as a child in 1st grade with a book on folding animals, and since then I've expanded to folding more complex structures and in particular, unit origami. There's a certain wonder of unit origami that [Tomoko Fuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Fuse) touches on in her books - modular origami is infinite. Most models can be expanded to any size, and creations with separate units that come together with connections can be as large as the imagination. That idea brought me back to origami this summer. I wanted to make something completely unique, something baffling or extraordinary. I wanted to challenge conventional thoughts on Origami and prove how striking this form of craft can be.
