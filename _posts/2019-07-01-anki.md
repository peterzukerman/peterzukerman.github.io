title: Why traditional language learning methods are ineffective, and why you should use an SRS
---

Language learning has become incredibly simple during the past few decades. We have access to endless textbooks, video calls, flashcard apps, and dictionaries at our fingertips. 

Unfortunatley, language education hasn't improved. A spanish class from the 80's would be functionally identical to one today (save for a few online homeworks). 

I love learning languages almost as much as I love taking shortcuts to solve problems, so naturally I was drawn to discussions of efficient and effective learning. I saw claims of "downloading" information to your brain, or even achieving fluency after just one month of study. 

So how do people learn information so effectively? The answer is surprisingly simple.

# What is a language?
I'm not talking about a linguists definition here - I mean for the learner. What are the things you need to learn when you think about 'mastering' a language?  
* Reading
* Writing
* Speaking
* Listening
* Pronunciation
* Memorization

These 6 pillars make up the backbone of any language. Without just one of them, it's hard to consider yourself truly fluent. Even having mastered these, native-like fluency has even higher demands:

1. Idioms, Metaphors, and Jokes
2. Poetry
3. Music
4. Cultural Background

It's a hefty task, and even the most ambitious learner might be put off by the sheer amount of effort required. But quite a few of these pillars can be mastered by studying correctly.

# Language Courses


Imagine you're studying for your French exam coming up. You made some flashcards online, or maybe wrote them out.

You've programmed these words into your short term memory, just enough to recall them on the test. Most students might remember 10 out of 30 words they encountered using this method. 

There's 2 problems: First, classes and textbooks are structured so that related items are grouped together. Learning information in this way is almost impossible, since your mind is focused on the specific group and can't make the necessary connection in your brain. It's much more effective to layer new information so that you learn body parts, colors, and numbers interspersed rather than at once.

Second, most students would never return to these flashcards as soon as they finish the test. This is a problem because most of the words will have left their short term memories very quickly. So how do we make sure we can cement every word in our mind, without leaving any behind?

# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is a a study method. At it's core, it's a system that rearranges when and what flashcards you see. It deals with both of the problems traditional language learning methods have. 

Imagine you have 15 new words that you want to learn today. You already know the first 10, and the last 5 you're struggling with. You deal with 4 of them, but the last one you keep missing. The system rearranges the cards so that you see the 10 you know less frequently, the 4 you dealt with more frequently, and the one you keep missing again and again until you get it. This orders all of your vocabulary, so that you see cards which you've missed more often. 

This is an efficient method - not only do you see information that you need depending on how well you know it, but it also ensures that you leave no words behind. Now, instead of never reviewing those 30 vocab words for a french test, instead you will continue seeing them at less frequent intervals during your future studies.

The more intervals you go through, the longer you will retain the information. The end goal is to get your intervals so long that they last months or years.

Try using an SRS to help enhance your language learning. You'll be surprised at how easily you remember new words and concepts.
