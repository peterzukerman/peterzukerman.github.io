<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
I’m a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I am studying Computer Science and Linguistics, with an interest in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am minoring in East Asian Languages and Cultures, and am actively working towards business proficiency in Japanese and Korean.
</br>
</br>
I have had 3 technical internships and 1 volunteer experience related to computer science. I was a software engineering intern at OverDrive Inc., Optima Solutions, and Rockwell Automation. I also volunteered at the CodeMash software convention, and gave a presentation on Unicode and text input. I am currently interning at VoiceItt, and I am part of their speech processing development team.
At university, I am involved in the AI research group, SIGAI. I am also a member of the computational linguistics league, and am doing statistical machine translation research on Siberian Yupik, a critical language in Alaska.
</br>
</br>
Currently I’m working at VoiceItt in Tel Aviv, Israel. There I do signal processing research and work to improve the speech recognition algorithm for noisy environments and accented speech. Recently I've been working on adding Amazon Alexa support for people who have speech disabilities.
