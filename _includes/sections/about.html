<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
Iâ€™m a senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I am studying Computer Science and Linguistics, with an interest in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am minoring in East Asian Languages and Cultures, and am actively working towards business proficiency in Japanese and Korean.
</br>
</br>
I have had 4 technical internships, a co-op, and 1 volunteer experience related to computer science. I was a software engineering intern at Raytheon BBN, VoiceItt, OverDrive, and Rockwell Automation. I also volunteered at the CodeMash software convention, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcsg2KSKDC4&ab_channel=PeterZukerman">gave a presentation</a> on Unicode and text input. 

At university, I am involved in the AI research group, SIGAI. I am also a member of the computational linguistics league, and am doing NLP research on Siberian Yupik, a critical language in Alaska. In January 2021, I started a co-op at Radiate as a full stack developer. Last summer I interned at Raytheon on the Competency Aware Machine Learning team, where I worked on explainable AI and ML agent visualization. Two summers ago I worked at VoiceItt in Tel Aviv, Israel. There I did signal processing research and worked to improve the speech recognition algorithm for noisy environments and accented speech. I also worked on adding Amazon Alexa support for people who have speech disabilities.

Currently I am finishing up my final semester at university and seeking full time positions.
